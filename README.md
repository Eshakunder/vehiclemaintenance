# Predictive Maintenance for Vehicle Engines

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a vehicle engine requires maintenance based on sensor data and performance parameters. The goal is to enable **predictive maintenance**, reducing unexpected failures and increasing engine efficiency.

The dataset used is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parvmodi/automotive-vehicles-engine-health-dataset).
